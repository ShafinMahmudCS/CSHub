                    We're partnering up with Lassonde Engineering Society to host a Leetcode session on November 8th, from 6-8 pm on Zoom.  Prolems from all categories (Easy/Medium/Hardcode). There will be mentors who will help you solve leetcode problems during the event.</br></br>

                    If you do not know what leetcode is, it's basically a website where you can solve problems which companies ask during coding interviews. You do not need prior experience as we're here to show you how to approach the thought process of these problems.</br></br>

        <p class="nxtpoint">With the constantly changing industry there are times when it may seem that our program doesn't adapt quickly enough. We aim to bridge the gap between what we learn in our classes and the technologies that many employers deem relevant.</p>
        <p class="point">2. Provide an environment that encourages creative thinking, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p class="nxtpoint">Our goal is to make students develop unique ways of thinking as well as encourage collaboration between other faculties in order to inspire projects that students are actually passionate about.</p>
        <p class="point">3. Create a more vibrant and engaged student community.</p>
        <p class="nxtpoint">We aspire to maintain a responsive collective where students can come to for input and advice, no matter whether it is their first year or their final year.</p>
